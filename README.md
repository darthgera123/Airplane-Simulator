# Airplane Simulator

The following project involves a 3D simulator of an aircraft in a miniworld consisting of airplane, checkpoint islands, volcano island and enemy parachutes. The features of the game are as follows:
+ The plane can move in all directions 
+ Smoke rings, extra points on passing through
+ Constant attack from checkpoint
+ Missiles and Bombs to kill enemies
+ Fuel updates so that plane doesnt die out
